Old ExtJS documentation, hosted here for convenience because Sencha doesn't host them anymore.

Downloading for offline use
---------------------------

Pull the `gh-pages` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/chris-martin/extjs-docs.git
git checkout gh-pages
```

Since the Ext docs webapp uses ajax, you also need to run a simple web server to use it. For example,

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

Then you should be able to go to `http://localhost:3000` and view it.
